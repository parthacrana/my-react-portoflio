I am an aspiring web developer looking for an entr level web developer position. 

This is the github repo for my portfolio! 

With tons of hours put into this website and future plans included in this readme file, I am proud to say that this is my first project build using HTML, CSS, JS via React! 

This is the website link to my portfolio deployed via Render! -- https://partha-port.onrender.com/home

Folder structure following MVC guidlines, with a seperate pages folder and a homepage folder, along with .jsx files incroporating web3forms API.

This project contains:
-working cards with my 3 most complex projects done with teams of 3-4, with links to their github repos and their deployed links where you can visit the website and explore it! 
-a contact me page with username and email information that gets stored into an array and sent in an email to my personal work email, from which I can respond to whoever sent their contact information! 
-a resume page where you can see quick information about me and what I have done throughout my 3 months since I chose to be a web developer 

Below are screenshots of what my portfolio looks like! Please feel free to explore my personal portfolio if you are interested in hiring me! I am also available for contract positions!
